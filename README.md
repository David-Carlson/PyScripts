# PyScripts

This is a collection of small scripts I've created to make my life easier, do graphic visualization, or anything my heart desires!

See each project folder for example on usage and more documentation. Check out each accompanying blog post for pretty pictures and methodology. 

### 1. [3D Scatter Art](https://github.com/David-Carlson/PyScripts/tree/master/3DScatterPlot) — [Blog Post](https://david-carlson.github.io/blog/3D-Scatter-plots)
This project aims to take input images and plot them as a 3D Scatter plot.


### 2. [Link Formatting Script](https://github.com/David-Carlson/PyScripts/tree/master/ProcessRedditLinks) — [Blog Post](https://david-carlson.github.io/blog/link-formatting-script)
This script takes a list of links & regular text as input and converts the links
titles into a readable format.

### 3. [Box proximity Detection](https://github.com/David-Carlson/PyScripts/tree/master/BoxProximity) — [—Blog Post](https://david-carlson.github.io/blog/box-proximity)
I wrote this to solve a challenge. In essence, decide whether a point is within a distance of a rectangle, which might be rotated.
