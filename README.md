# PyScripts

This is a collection of small scripts I've created to make my life easier, do graphic visualization, or anything my heart desires!

### 1. 3D Scatter Plot
This project aims to take input images and plot them as a 3D Scatter plot.

#### Usage
```
python PlotImage.py *.jpg --points 20000 --save --pprint
```
PlotImage expect at least one image filepath, and will accept optional parameters
- --points [number] (Limits the number of pixels plotted)
- --save            (Will save each plot as 'pprint-originalname')
- --pprint          (Removes axis labels, titles and other details from the plot)

### 2. Processing
