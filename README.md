# PyScripts

This is a collection of small scripts I've created to make my life easier, do graphic visualization, or anything my heart desires!

See each project folder for usage.

### 1. [3D Scatter Plot](https://david-carlson.github.io/blog/3D-Scatter-plots)
This project aims to take input images and plot them as a 3D Scatter plot.


### 2.  [Processing Reddit links](https://david-carlson.github.io/blog/link-formatting-script)
This script takes a list of links & regular text as input and converts the links
titles into a readable format.

### 3. [Box proximity](https://david-carlson.github.io/blog/box-proximity)
I wrote this to solve a challenge. In essence, decide whether a point is within a distance of a rectangle, which might be rotated.
